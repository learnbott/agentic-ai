      " Welcome to the AIP Asset Management and XIPO webinar. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the meeting is being recorded. If you are on a mobile device, it's recommended that you turn the device to a horizontal position for a larger view of the slide deck. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. At any time during the meeting, you may click on the Q&A icon on the left-hand side of the screen to submit your question in writing. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Jay Bala with XIPO. Please go ahead. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us today. My name is Jay Bala. I am the president and CEO of Access Pre-IPOs. It's a company that's giving investors exposure and access to global large-cap assets. We are a multi-talented, high-growth private company that is going to be a big shareholder in the market and is going to be a key part of the company's growth. This will be a company that will hold the top 10 to 25 pre-IPO US tech and AI companies, companies such as OpenAI and SpaceX and a lot of the names that you are familiar with. It is a company that will trade on the T-Line venture with the ticker symbol XIPO. It will be a company that will be able to sell its products to the market as a whole. And so our mission statement is really to make pre-IPO stocks accessible to Main Street. And so what do we mean by that? The way it works right now is, a very small group of people have access to pre-IPO companies. Basically, 1% of the population can access these companies simply because they are institutions or they are accredited investors. And 99% of society cannot. And by putting it in the public shell and listing it on the Toronto Stock Exchange, it on the Toronto the TSX venture this will allow everyone to be able to participate in these kinds of offerings and so as we have mentioned the name of the company will be access pre-ipo tech corporation it will hold the top 10 to 25 pre-ipo us tech names and it will trade on the TSX venture under the ticker symbol xipo and this is basically the corporate structure that would that would sit in in terms of the pre-ipo market you know this has significantly evolved over the last 20 or 30 years so pre-ipo company really 30 years ago meant somebody relatively younger with a powerpoint presentation minimal revenues and had you know huge ambitions huge dreams and as an example of that we have a company called the TSX venture which is a company that has been in the market for a long time and has been in the market for a long time and has been a long time and has been invested in a small large company that has grown to be a leading investor that has been a leading investor in the market for a long time and from an investor you've made that binary bet you either believed in management or you didn't if you fast forward to today that market has grown exponentially today that is a three trillion AUM market so to give you context that's about the size of the Toronto stock exchange and probably a little smaller than the London stock exchange so very significant in terms of market size and if you look at the size of these companies they are blue chip in nature so if you look at a company like SpaceX its last valuation round was 180 billion dollars and that would make it bigger than telus bigger than bell canada bigger than verizon and so it would make it one of the largest telcos on the planet the same goes for open ai at 86 billion stripe at 50 billion epic games at 21 billion these are very sizable companies with huge backers institutional backers and so what's happened to this market is because of the sheer size of this market the the way you access these shares has also changed there are numerous platforms where you can buy secondary shares and you're buying these secondary shares or we are buying secondary shares off of x employees and we're buying it from vc funds or pe funds that are looking for liquidity positions looking to get some liquidity that they can pass back to their lpc and that's really the reason we're able to get these discounts from the last institutional raise and so you know the one thing to mention about this market is you know unlike the nasdaq which is at an all-time high today because you know this market is limited to a very small number of people it is still possible to get these shares at a discount to the last institutional round so you know in my opinion it's really important that we try to get these shares and give them more my entire career of the last 20 to 30 years, this is the first time I've seen an ability for retail to actually get pricing that's a little cheaper than institutions. Usually it goes the other way around. And so if you look at the model portfolio we've proposed of these top 10 stocks that will be held by XIPO, we're averaging about a 27% discount. These prices obviously move around quite a bit, but we feel that gives investors a significant cushion for those that are investing in XIPO. So that's a bit about the market. In terms of what kind of stocks are we looking at and why is it that these pre-IPO companies are so important? The reality is the larger IPOs have done quite well in the market. And if you look at the market today, it is very much a tech-driven AI. It's not a tech-driven AI. It's not a tech-driven AI. It's not a tech-driven AI. It's not a tech-driven AI. It's not a tech-driven AI. It's not a tech-driven AI. It's not a tech-driven rally. And we think that will continue going forward. And so we've just looked at the 10 largest IPOs of 2023 and 2024. On average, they're up about 55%. And if you were to strip out the outliers, you're still seeing a very, very significant return. So in terms of the types of companies we're selecting, we're looking for companies that we could get at a bit of a discount to the last institutional round. We're looking for companies that are going to be able to have near-term IPO capability, which means they'll go public in the next 12 to 18 months, because there's obviously that significant pop you can get from it. And number three that we're looking for in terms of criteria is really the idea of index inclusion. And so today, if you look at the market in North America, both in Canada and the US, it is a heavily indexed market, which means in a 70 to 80 percent of the capital that goes into the North American capital markets goes through ETFs, goes through indexes, goes through closet indexes. And because of this, being included in any index has significant upside potential. So the company we'd like to isolate and has demonstrated this very well is a company called Supermicro. And Supermicro, we've showed it over the last five years. And what you notice is over the last four years, we've shown that the index is going to be a little bit more of a drop in the index. And so we're looking for companies that are going to be able to take a step further. And the reason that we're looking for companies that are going to be able to take a step further is because of the fact that this company has been a very, very dominant investor in the last five years. And so what we're looking for is a stock that hasn't done much. And then it has basically two events, right? The first event is that it's tied to the Nvidia rally, which is now the most valuable company in the world. And so the stock rallies in the news that they are a vendor or supplier to Nvidia. But the biggest jump in valuation is that it eventually does. And this is huge rally once that's announced, I mean, as that is building. And this stock basically rallies from $300 a share to about 1000. And that's really just driven by the idea that this company Supermicro gets admitted to the S&P 500. And so what happens is, once you're admitted to an index, every ETF, every index fund is a forced purchaser of your stock. And so the market is going to be a little bit more competitive. And so that's what drives that value so much. And so, you know, when we're looking at, you know, what kind of stocks, you know, what's going to make up this top 10 to top 25 pre IPO companies and ex IPO, you know, we're looking for companies where we have a high conviction that it's going to get included into an index. And this is really where we're going to exit. So you know, we want to come in, in the pre IPO markets, where we can still get a bit of a discount, we want to participate when these stocks go public. And you have that initial pop, and we want to participate paid again, once they get onto the index. And then that's our selling call. That's when we sell and we reload into a different or different stock. So in terms of you know, how do we make our our, you know, investment process. And so you know, like I had mentioned, there are over 1200 unicorns, you know, and so like I had mentioned, there are over 1200 unicorns. And so, you know, like I had mentioned, there are over 1200 unicorns. And so Unicorn is really a company that's valued north of $1 billion. And so these are the only companies we're looking at for XIP. We're not looking at startups. We're not looking to pick the next unicorn. There's already a lot of unicorns out there. We're just selecting amongst the larger cap, more liquid unicorn names like, again, SpaceX, the Open AIs, the Epic Games of the world. And so how do we do the investment process and the selection? First, we start with sector selection. And so it's really a top-down approach. We're looking at the market and we're saying, look, what's going to drive this bull market for the next four or five years? What sector is really going to drive that? And the answer is really it's a clear winner. If you look at the types of stocks that are rallying and who's driving this sector forward, it's U.S. tech and U.S. AI stocks. It's a clear winner. Right. And so. So, you know, as a sector, we've picked that as a sector. The next one we're looking at is, you know, obviously country selection. So, you know, there's a lot of good companies in China, for example, the biggest one being ByteDance, which is the owner of TikTok. And of course, there's Temu and Xien, which are all very large companies. But we've decided to exclude China from this portfolio for a simple reason in that I don't think investors want to take on EM risk. They don't want the. Emerging market risk. And so we're trying to keep it clean, vanilla, simple. We don't want to overcomplicate this. It's a pretty simple process and we want investors to understand exactly what it is that they're getting. And the answer is, you know, you buy X IPO, you're going to get exposure to the top 10 to 25 U.S. technology and artificial intelligence stocks. There'll be no emerging market risk in there. We want stocks. Stocks that, you know, we believe we have a high conviction of going public in the near term, which means the next 12 to 18 months. The minimum market cap requirement is $1 billion. So we're only looking at the larger, more blue chip names. And we want companies that will have a strong capability to get listed onto any index. And so I'm going to flip back one page and we're going to talk a bit more about this index inclusion and where we think the low-hanging fruit is. And so I'm going to flip back one page and we're going to talk a bit more about this index inclusion and where we think the low-hanging fruit is. And so I'm going to flip back one page and we're going to talk a bit more about this index inclusion and where we think the low-hanging fruit is. So, you know, we talked about Supermicro and this company has been listed for years and years and recently got listed on the index. And you've seen that triple. It's gone up very significantly. And so the reality for Supermicro is it's very difficult to have predicted this. Right. But we believe the low-hanging fruit is in the pre-IPO market. And so if you look at. The pre-IPO market and think about, you know, which one of these companies would most likely get included into an index. You know, it really does just come down to mapping out the indexes and figuring out, well, which indexes could these companies land in? So, you know, if you look at, you know, the threshold limits for the Nasdaq 100, you know, the minimum market cap requirement is $20 billion. And it has to be a very liquid stock. You know, the Russell 3000, for example. It's, you know. A minimum market cap threshold of a billion dollars. You know, lots of liquidity required. So every index has its own requirements, but there is a way to map it. And so if you look at, you know, again, SpaceX with $180 billion valuation and Elon talks a lot and is very well known in the media circles. So it will be a liquid stock. And so if you think about that, you know, it's got a very high probability of being on the Nasdaq 100. You know, same goes for OpenAI at $86 billion. Stripe at $50 billion will also probably get included. And, you know, even companies like Epic Games, if they don't make the Nasdaq 100, you know, they might still make the Russell 1000 or the Russell 2000. So all of these companies that we've selected, we think is the relatively low hanging fruit in terms of index inclusion. And again, you know, we've talked about, you know, how significant those returns can be if we're able to select. Those stocks accurately. And so in terms of the due diligence process and the investment timeline for purchasing private company stocks or pre IPO stocks. So it's a much different environment than public companies. So to buy a public company, you know, everybody in the call here can buy a public company within seconds. You can go on your online trading account. You can put in the ticker symbol and press buy. You can sell and you'd have your trade executed within seconds. With a pre IPO company, because it's the private markets, it's a four to eight week process. And here we've just really detailed out, you know, what does that process look like? And that process really, you know, starts with that investment process of looking at 1200 companies, deciphering it down and say, you know, which ones do we want to seriously look at? And then there's the origination and preliminary due diligence phase where we're looking at companies. Where there are stocks available for sale and, you know, we're negotiating terms. So we're sending in an LOI and we're negotiating terms. That's about a one to three week process. Once they've signed off on the term sheet, the seller, then we're getting into due diligence and closing. So, you know, we're running the whole gambit. And this is something we've done for many, many years here and the team. So, you know, we'll talk a bit more about the team in the next slide. But this is a very robust due diligence process. It's a very time intensive due diligence process. And so you got to have the right team who really knows what they're doing in these markets to make sure that you're getting exactly what you want out of this. And then, you know, once that's done, you know, we have to do legal documents and closing, which also takes another one to three weeks. So it's a very intensive process. And then once that's done, you know, we have an internalized team here that does the monitoring of each one of these investments to make sure that, you know, the macro trends are not affecting it, that the investment team remains steady and so on. In terms of, you know, who are we? So AIP Asset Management will be the company that will be managing this portfolio for XIPO. And so we'll be doing the selection of those stocks and making sure that it stays according to mandate. And our background really is, you know, we've been running a company, a fund called AIP. And so we've been running a company, a fund called AIP. And so we've been running a company, a fund called AIP. And so we've been running a company, a fund called AIP. AIP Convertible Private Debt Fund for the last 10 years. We're one of the best performing funds, both here in Canada and the U.S. We've won many, many awards on that basis. And this just really speaks to our, you know, ability to manage a portfolio like this, our experience in both the public and private markets here in North America. And so, you know, when we talked about the due diligence process, you know, we're one of the best performing funds here in Canada and the U.S. We've won many, many awards on that basis. And so we've been running a company, a fund called AIP. And so we've been running a company, a fund called AIP. And so we've been running a company, a fund called AIP. Our team has over 100 years of combined private and public market experience. And we've done many, many transactions, both in the private and public markets for decades. In terms of the team and advisors, you know, I'll be the CEO of the company and the president. Alex Kanaev will be the CFO of our company. He brings a great depth of credit experience and private market experience. And we've done a lot of work. And we've done a lot of work. And so we've been able to put together a great, you know, board of directors, two of which are here with me today. And we'll speak a little bit about, you know, their experience with IPL. So, you know, John Cooper, he'll be here to speak. And, you know, he was previously the president of Morgan Stanley in New York, as well as the president of Invesco's distribution arm. And, you know, he'll give you a bit of a background on why he thinks this is a great transaction, and why he got it. And, you know, he's been a very successful investor in the market. And he's been a very successful investor in the market. And Richard Stone, many of you may know, well-known here in Toronto and Canada, and was the founder and CIO of Stone Asset Management. And so just in terms of, you know, why this product, you know, why do we think this is particularly applicable to the retail investor market? And, you know, why is it that you can't do it yourself, right? So the typical retail problem, really is a function of access, right? The reality is, it's a $3 trillion market. But most people, 99% of society simply cannot access it. And you don't have access for two basic reasons. Number one is just its capital, right? Like if you don't have a significant amount of capital, you simply cannot participate in this world. At the very least, you have to be an accredited investor or an institution. And if you think about trading a private company shares, like if you wanted to buy OpenAI shares or Epic Games, the minimum threshold, the minimum trade is $500,000 to $1 million. And so if you wanted to buy 10 stocks, you need anywhere between five and $10 million. And at that price point, you pretty much priced out 99% of society. The other one, of course, is just, you know, the liquidity functionality of it. You know, again, you know, it takes several months or several years to get out of a private position. Um, if you go through a, you know, a VC fund or anything else. And so, you know, we're providing daily liquidity on our vehicle, which is again, X IPO. And then, you know, if you just think about the broader context of, you know, even if you're an advisor with a very large book of business and you've got, you know, half a billion dollars in assets, you know, if you think about the rationality of it, let's say you bought a million dollars worth of X of SpaceX for your client. And it really makes the question of, you know, how do you price it? Right? Like there's no pricing on, on SpaceX. How do you value it? How do you custody it? Right? Because at the end of the day, your custodian won't hold private shares. So it becomes a bit of a nightmare for you to hold private shares. And we think, you know, X IPO solves a lot of those problems in that, you know, since it's a publicly traded vehicle on the TSX venture, uh, ticker symbol X IPO. And so, you know, that's the starting price would be $10. Now, anyone with 10 bucks or $20, can buy and sell the shares. You can buy and sell it on a daily basis. So it's very liquid and you're getting a diversified portfolio. We're taking care of all of the valuation concerns and, you know, for any kind of custody or admin burdens, you know, you've got a ticker symbol, you've got a QSIP number, you've got a stock price on it. So it makes your life much, much simpler and much, much easier. I'm just going to skip over to this one, you know, in terms of just allocation, you know, in terms of just allocation, you know, in terms of just allocation, you know, in terms of just allocation, for any of you out there that are kind of thinking about this as portfolio managers or sort of fee based accounts, you know, we run the model for you here. Um, and so in terms of just a traditional portfolio, we've assumed it's a 60 40 model. So 60% equity is 40% fixed income. And so that's what the traditional portfolio is. And then we've said on the left hand side, you know, what happens if you add 5% of X IPO? And what you see is, you get significant alpha, right? You know, the traditional 60 40 portfolio would have generated a return of 10.9%. With X with 5% X IPO, you know, your total returns would go up to 12 and a half percent. But the better part of the story is, you know, what happens to the risk of the portfolio? And what you'll notice is the standard deviation stays about the same at 8.2%. And so does the downside risk. And so, you know, I think it's a, as, you know, as a portfolio, you know, you're going to have to make a lot of changes. So you'll see some significant value add for anyone that's looking to add alternatives or pre IPO companies to their client portfolios. And just in terms of, you know, where do we see the market cycle today? And you know, why do we think it's a good place to invest today in this? You know, I'm a big believer, personally, in the idea of market cycles. So if you look at, you know, So in the stock market over the last 70 years, we've had 10 distinct bear markets. And so, you know, if you break it out, every cycle is about seven years. You know, the average bear market is about two years and the average bull market is about five. And so, you know, if you look at where we are in that process today, I think the bull market is done. I think we're in the first year of a five year bull run. And companies like these do incredibly well in a risk on environment where we think there is a bull market ahead of us. And just in terms of, you know, why invest now, you know, why is X IPO good for your portfolio at this point in time? You know, we've talked about where we think the market is. We've talked about, you know, what does this provide for your client base? And so, you know, really, you know, I think it's a unique. Opportunity that, you know, we can still buy shares at a discount in the secondary markets, which gives investors in X IPO a small cushion. I think, you know, like I said, one of the few times in my career, I've actually seen it where retail investors can get shares cheaper than the institutions themselves. Number two is we're seeing a rebound in the IPO markets. You know, the stock markets have an all time high, both here in Canada and the US. And, you know, with that. We think there'll be a steady stream of IPOs, which, again, you know, will result in that lift we've talked about. And then, you know, in terms of just that four year, five year bull run we talked about, you know, there's a lot of macro dynamics that are going to help elevate the equity markets for the next few years. The biggest one, of course, being, you know, over the next call it four or five years, we're going to see interest rates come down. I don't think they'll go up anymore. And so as interest rate cuts happen, you know, more and more cash. And so, you know, we're going to see a lot of capital will flood into the equity markets, which will then push up equity valuations. And of course, number four is there is a lot of pressure on venture capital funds to exit their positions. You know, a lot of these LPs have been long in the tooth and they're looking for exits. And so, you know, I think that's going to add additional pressure for these companies to to either go public or to sell these shares that are discounted in the private markets. And so, you know, with that. You know, we'll just finish with the last point, just to circle up. And so, look, I mean, the key thing, you know, with XIPO, what we're looking to do is, you know, we're trying to give access in a simple liquid format for investors to put in decline portfolios. And again, you know, we're looking for companies, number one, that traded a discount to the last institutional round. Number two, there are high profile blue chip IPO companies or pre IPO companies that will go public. And so, you know, we're looking for companies that are going to go public in the near term. So the next 12 to 18 months. And we're looking for the larger cap companies that have a strong conviction where we have a strong conviction for index inclusion. And I think with that, you know, I think I'll like to introduce you to John Cooper, one of our board members. Thank you very much. Sure. Thank you very much, Jay. And good morning to everyone. And thank you very much for for joining us. Mike. My points of emphasis are going to be I'm going to spend six, seven minutes or so. And the things I want to emphasize are the strong management team and their results, that this is indeed a unique and differentiated concept with unique access and then diversification, not only of client portfolios, but also an opportunity for you to potentially diversify your your client base. So what attracted me to AIP is that, you know, first of all, I'm a client. I'm a business owner. I'm a business owner. I've had the privilege of being on the investment side of this business for 30 some odd years. And I've seen plenty of investment concepts and theses and so forth. And the one constant for great results is that it has to be implemented by a strong team. And so when you look at the team at AIP, you've got 10 years of strong and steady investment results, winning numerous industry awards. Both go through a pandemic of sort of refinement and the other half, say to be continued in many other aspects of this career. And that to me really is a very hot topic because of the convention to build on both the day one and the very morning was to provide all the resources that, GE can deliver. That'll be the federal, the government can provide, which is barriers. Those are tools that have everything to do with, and this also shares us to use this belief. We're able to, you know, Seventy percent of these award-winning returns were derived from equity upside and pre-IPOs companies. So the other thing that's critical is the timeliness of this offering. It is indeed interesting and unique concept. It's also offered at the right time and not one of many others. And as we've seen with alternatives such as hedge funds, private equity, private credit, these offerings usually start out in the hands of institutions and family offices and the ultra wealthy. They're also locked up for many years. Eventually, access to these capabilities becomes more widely available. So the concept, access, and liquidity, and the opportunity to educate is timely. I've seen so many studies in the beginning of industry trends like ETFs or SMAs or all the different alternatives products, whether private credit, private equity, hedge funds, and so forth. And there always seems to be a gap in the awareness of investors' interest in better understanding how these trends and products will affect them. So this is an opportunity for you to be that trusted source and democratize the education of this concept. The timing also gives you. The chance to discuss something fresh with clients and prospects. And then also right now, you've got cash levels still near an all-time high globally. So there's an opportunity for money to work as well. It's also clearly a diversifier. As I mentioned, diversification of portfolios, but also diversification and growth of your own business. We're seeing a massive and constant global wealth transfer. Money in motion in the coming years. Some 1.4 trillion in Canada and trillions more around the globe. And investors are going from an income-biased investing approach to transferring to heirs who are likely going to be more seeking capital appreciation. So you can diversify your business by discussing something that will appeal to existing clients and their families. But also with prospects and their families as well. You can engage with several generations. If you don't. Engage given this timeliness, it could be your competitors that do so. So offers the ability to approve returns from an alternative and diversified sources. You saw from Jay's comments and Richard's going to cover these in more detail in a moment. So the IPO market and access to pre IPO companies will certainly be on investors minds. In closing out, I, when I started out in the business. Um. I was talking with an industry friend, uh, many years ago. He's actually now the CEO of a global financial services firm, and he gave me some great advice. He said the best financial advisors, no matter how sophisticated their clients are provide guidance, education, and are constantly in touch. And he said, if you can provide them with help them with client service, help them with client acquisition, give them a view on the markets and give them an. Act. A reasonable idea. They're gonna be able to better serve their clients. A discussion around provides an ideal platform to do all all four. So, this is an opportunity for you to serve your client and engage with them, whether they invest or not. I'm sure they're going to appreciate that. You took the opportunity to educate them and guide them. And now we'll turn it over to Richard for some of the investment commentary. Thanks, John. I appreciate that. And thanks very much, John. I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you today. And I'm going to turn it over to Richard to talk about some of the other things that we've been talking about. So, I think, I'll definitely cut away and say this in just a minute, this is about more than just aつ. So, as Trans razor talk about, the looks of doing something for agents. And Prot segment. This is about the way you不能 say roots. Wait a minute. Let me grab that minute. Do you have any vision to tell a direct return story to $35 billion? Oh, I think Chris and I talked about this a little bit. It is about the amount of capital you're putting into it. How much you're thinking about putting into it. The restaurant experts should appreciate cashς and all of these kind of things, right? And So, you may start out with things like, we're going to make a profit and then you're still, we're going to leverage because we want to obvious interests. Is there a big song for those who want to yineiest. Share with them what they like. Thanks, John. I appreciate that. And thanks very much, Jay, for an excellent presentation. I've been in the business since 1979 on Bay Street. I was fortunate enough to run my own firm for 27 years and function as chief investment officer. I'd like to talk a little bit in the next five to seven minutes from that perspective as a chief investment officer and why I got compelled to join the AIP team and, in particular, XIPO. I think the mission statement is a very powerful statement and provides a lot of clarity. Making pre-IPO stocks accessible to the main street by investing in some of the most innovative private companies globally before the masses can. I think it's just a really powerful statement. When I started in the business, you had a telephone that was strapped inside your car, and then you got to carry a brick around to have a mobile telephone. Now we have handheld phones that are, you're listening to this whole presentation on that phone. It's got more power than computers, et cetera, et cetera. You're all aware of these data points. What's happened in the last 25 to 30 years is an unprecedented growth in technology and through that technology, how the whole world functions. And it comes with positives and negatives. And this building of the private equity market and the private debt market over the last 30 years has been unbelievable. The size of these companies that have, that be pre-going public are amazing. How's that affected the advisor channel? And how's that affected investors is really quite interesting. You've seen asset allocation and portfolio construction change fairly dramatically. When I came into the business, everything was a public market. It was listed on an exchange or traded on. We traded as fixed income on the bond desk. Then mutual funds showed up and they gave a place for GIC refugees to take money. But we stayed there in this public market for a long time. Everything traded on exchange. We went from transaction-based compensation to fee-based compensation, and that was a long-term evolution that took place. We saw major organizations such as the Canadian banks coming into the industry. We saw the consolidation of the four pillars. So as this change kept taking place, so did how people wanted to invest. The regulators controlled the public market. The regulators had soft oversight into the private market. Institutions wanted more flexibility. So suddenly what we call the alt market started to build, and it had rapid growth. From there, we now have people that manage money public market only, alt market only, and blend. What? What? What? What? What? But later, during our business, more power came in from the act of Long-term Oval Reserve. So now what really happened was we were�� in things like digital assets and your infecting companies, all of a sudden the People's Investing Show opened up. It is virtually a virtual experience. So, it wasn't really an zaten stream of overview tangible communication on the impact of data sources, social advertising, or reputable scientific and tax data across the et cetera. And I believe we extended more flexibility. A relationship came around. They nostrapped us. with their private debt side of the business. And as John mentioned earlier, the track record speaks well for itself. I think that when you look at why investing now, there are some drivers. And I think that why investing now is there's a timing issue that's taking place. And this timing issue is not a small window. It's probably a solid two-year horizon to three years. And it's driven by Jay's position that we're entering into a bull market. We've got the better part of a five-year cycle on the bull side. So when you look at why investing now, there are three timing components in there. The interest rates coming down will create a real powerful valuation, upside valuation opportunity for these companies, because the tail earnings are going to be cheap compared with the interest rates. Lower interest rates and stock prices need to go higher to recognize that. Interest rate cuts being that driver are supported by the fact that there's going to be significant upside on the equity. And we've seen that taking place with the issues that have come to the market. But best of all, in that timing cycle is that most of the PE and VC portfolios are maturing. So they have to come to the market. They've got to start to create liquidity. They're investors. So you've got product coming to the market, while at the same time, you've got interest rates changing in favor of you. And you've got a significant upside based on those two criteria. So if you're running a portfolio for your clients, your asset allocation model now really needs to not just look at the public markets and the GIX sectoring of that, and looking at the relationship between fixed income and its movement and how it's going to drop. And that's where you're going to have to start looking at the private markets. And you have to deal with the lack of liquidity. And so I believe this is a really powerful fit in a portfolio because of its combination of giving access to the private equity, being disciplined to be pre IPO and giving you liquidity because it's a publicly listed entity. And the team running the money have all the background skill set to do it. And they have a lot of expertise in the private market. And they have a lot of experience. And they have a lot of experience. And they have history. And they have a lot of experience. So in closing, I joined the team because Jay and Alex makes sense. Their vision looking forward is really clear. Their skill set to execute with that vision is outstanding. And I believe that they're bringing something really powerful and beneficial for your practice and your clients. And at this, I'd like to turn the call back over to Jay. And thank you everybody for attending today. Jay. Thank you, Richard. Thank you, John. Definitely a lot of stuff to think about there. And certainly a lot of good advice. So thank you so much for that. Now, I turn it over to Warren just to start the Q&A. There are a few questions, I believe. Thank you, Jay. Hi, everyone. I'm Warren Ahrens, VP Business Development at AIP Asset Management. At this point, I'd like to first of all thank everyone again for taking the time to join us today to learn about access pre IPOs. We'll open it up to the Q&A portion of the webinar now. If you have a question, please type it in the chat box. And we'll try and get to your question over the next 10 minutes or so in the interest of keeping everybody on time and out of here for your 12 o'clock appointment. Let's look at the questions we have here received so far. Okay, Jay. Thomas from Edmonton asks, is this for accredited investors only or PM accreditation based? Who can subscribe? That's a great question. Thanks for asking that. So I guess it's a two part question. So. X IPO itself is a publicly listed entity on the Toronto Stock Exchange Venture. And so, you know, once it starts trading, anybody can buy it, whether you're accredited, non-accredited or just anybody else. So whoever can purchase a stock can purchase this in terms of this financing round that we're doing is only for accredited investors or people that, you know, PMs that can accredit for investors or under that PM accreditation. And so you can know a lot of things and you can start doing your ownBEIT, you know, or, you know, emмос, et cetera. But, um, and they're all okay. I'll, I'll leave it to you to, to ask more questions and have a discussion about how do you decide which businesses you want to targeting. And then if you have an idea about, you know, what you're going to talk about for next week's reduzir point. And just editing, or writing back to me on the website and putting it into your A almost talk about one of my favoriteлаver which we talked about, I love it. It's calledięcy Chemicals. And they've done a lot of stuff in terms of how do you change sample results. And of course when it comes to similar product, I know scientists are going to have that work and obtain those results. It's starting to work better for you. Sure. No, no. I mean, I will add to that. So look, I mean, you know, this is not an OM product. We should be very clear about that. This is a public company. There is a prospectus. All the information will be on CDAR. It's full transparency. We will provide quarterly financial statements, audited financial statements every year. And so you will have every piece of information that a public company needs to provide to you. Great. Thanks, Jay. Okay, let's take a look. Bill from Vancouver asks, can you explain to me about buying private equity, but having liquidity for my clients? Great question. That is a great question. And I think we addressed this on one of the slides. So look, buying private equity. So buying, let's say, Epic Games, which is, you know, the guys that do 4G. Huge company, well-known company. You know, if you were to buy it in the private markets, it would be a four to eight week process. There is a ton of due diligence that goes through it. And we have discussed that. And so if you want to buy or sell it, it would take you a very significant amount of time and it would cost you a very significant amount of money in terms of due diligence as well as legals. Right. And so the difference is by taking a stock like that and putting it into X IPO. What you're getting is you're getting the same exposure to this company, but now it's a stock. It sits in your portfolio, like in your brokerage account. And so if the market turns on you or you get a new piece of information and you wish to trade on that, now you trade it like any other stock. You can just simply get on your TD Waterhouse system or any other direct investor or brokerage you have and sell or you could hit buy. Yeah. And that's it. It happens in seconds. So, you know, the point of creating this product was to make your life simple. Right. Instead of spending, you know, weeks and weeks with lawyers and investment analysts trying to suss out or figure out what to buy and how to buy it and how to hold it. We're trying to make this as simple and as easy as humanly possible for you in that this will be no different to you than buying any other stock that's listed. So, you know, we're trying to make this as simple as humanly possible for you in that this will be no different to you than buying any other stock that's listed. So, you know, we're trying to make this as simple as humanly possible for you in that this will be no different to you than buying any other stock that's listed. Okay, great. Thanks, Jay. Just looking at the time here. So we're at 1145. I think we should, in the interest of keeping everyone on time, maybe wrap up here. Thanks, everyone, for all of these great questions. There are more great questions in the chat box. Sorry we didn't get to everyone's question today. Please reach out to us or the team at Oak Hill with your questions and we will get back to you with the answers. It'll be a pleasure. It'll be a pleasure to do that. I'll pass it back to Jay for closing comments now. Thanks, Jay. Look, I mean, thank you, everyone, for joining us. And thank you to our illustrious board members for taking the time to share their thoughts with all of you. And, look, thank you once again and have a good afternoon. This brings to a conclusion today's webinar, You May Disconnect. Thank you for participating and have a pleasant day.\n"
